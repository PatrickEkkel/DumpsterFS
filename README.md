# DumpsterFS


Portable filesystem that is designed to be compatible with services like Hastebin, Github, Pastebin and other services that allow uploading text files. 

At this moment i have no build system in place, so if you want to run it install the following.

for Ubuntu
apt-get install Python3.7  
apt-get install pip3  

pip3 install fusepy  
pip3 install numpy  

git clone this repository and start fuse_dfs.py   

I have not tested it anywhere else besides my laptop, so i could be missing something.
